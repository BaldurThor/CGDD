"exp": "Experience is required to level up and gain new abilities and weapons.",
"explosive": "Explosive weapons do not deal damage on impact, but rather after a short delay.",
"explosive_radius_mod": "Multipliers to explosion radius are applied after flat increases.",
"explosive_weapon": "This weapon scales with explosion modifiers.",
"extra_projectiles": "Guns fire an additional projectile based on the number of extra projectiles. Some weapons fire all projectiles at once.",
"friendly_fish": "The friendly fish gains an additional fish per melee strike, and scales with both range and attack speed.",

"regen_amount_flat": "+# health regen: A flat amount of health recovered per regeneration tick.",
"regen_amount_percentile": "+#% health regen: A % of your maximum health regenerated per regen tick.",
"regen_speed": "Regen speed: The speed at which you regenerate health. Default is every 2 seconds.",
"regen_speed_mod": "Regen speed affects the rate at which you regenerate health. The default time between ticks is 2 seconds.",
